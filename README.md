The app provides User Interface based on Jupyter's [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) for managing basic Machine Learning workflows. You can launch it using Binder badge above or installing app locally.

The app was originally developed as part of research project, funded by **St. Petersburg State University**, to help researchers solve problems of non-equilibrium gas dynamics using machine learning methods.
